Overview & requirements
We have provided you with an API that returns movie data. Your task is to build an interface that allows a user to search for movies and filter the returned results. They should also be able to get additional information about any individual movie (this may require a second call to the API). 
Requirements:
Must haves
- A user can input a search term and see the returned movies
- A user can input a year and see the returned results
- Returned results should display the movie poster, title and release year

The site should be responsive across all devices

Nice to haves 
- A user can request more info about a particular movie
- When the user first lands on the page some movies are already displayed
- A user can filter the returned results in an appropriate way

Documentation
http://www.omdbapi.com/
Follow the documentation at the OMDB API site to get yourself an API key and make requests to the database.
Submission
Your code should be pushed up to a github repository and the url sent over to us. Your final commit should be no later than midnight 29/07.

Further changes I would make

Search years by adding a forward slash before the year: /2020 
Rename capitalised variables to camelcase
